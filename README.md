## Testing 
 
I have used gitpod, github, and google devtools under my design and texting phases. Used git commands for saving and pushing the code from gitpod to github.

Under the testings I have only used google chrome as webbrowser.

Problems or issues under the design and testing have been a lot. because I am just in my begining to become a full stack coder. Basic typing errors, used wrong tags, elements, attributes etc. I have used code Institute as a baseline for information, slack community, w3school for guidence. And also used my mentor for the code institute for support.

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
